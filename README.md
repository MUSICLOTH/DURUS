# DURUS
The DURUS rocket is a high power rocket being built for launch, to build my engineering experience to fuel my passion for experience and Aviation.

DURUS includes a AV Bay with a flight controller/Altimeter which allows for control within, featuring GPS Tracking and a RF Tracker for advanced tracking and location sensing within. The electronics bay allows for system control within DURUS itself, and allows for it to fly up to 2500 feet high! Including a Aerotech 54mm HP SU DMS Motor - I65W-P	motor, allowing for it to fly up to high speeds maintaining control and a controlled descent with a dual parachute system. Including two payloads, this rocket allows for the innovation of space flight and data collection methods in aerospace! Paired with fins and a nose cone shape that are specifically designed and engineered for the maximization of aerodynamics for the best time of flight and highest apogee possible.

DURUS is paired with optimal flight gear, and specifically engineered for flight performance methods that reach for as high as possible! Designed with colors and designs that allow for a aesthetic look. DURUS is paired with stabilization methods that are fail proof which allow for controlled lift-off, flight, and descent.
